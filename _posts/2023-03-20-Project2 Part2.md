For project3, I am partner with Umesh Rao and John Rollman to summarize the Northwind Employee Performance Report from Northwind SQLite dataset, which contains schematic information for managing small business ERP. For our report, we mainly focused on the Orders, Order Details, Categories, Products and Employees tables to evalulate employee's performance from 1996 to 1998.
