Thanks for stopping by! This is Yi's GitHub blog for the class ST 554: Big Data Analysis. It contains few projects that I've done in this class using Python. In this course, we discusse big data management, predictive analytics, and applications of big data.  Literate programming and other good programming practices are covered as well.
